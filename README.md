# PlateMath
Platemath is a powerlifting training companion app, allowing users to input their one-rep maxes for the big three lifts: squat, bench, and deadlift. These values allow PlateMath to calculate the Rate of Perceived exertion coeffecients for given sets and reps, and displays an animation of a barbell that allows the user to easily visualize how to load the barbell
